# configs
all the configs i'll ever need. 

it's easiest to set up via symlinks. just run the following set of commands.

currently the following is my setup.
```shell
ln -s ./latex ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
ln -s ./nvim ~/.config/nvim
ln -s ./aerospace ~/.config/aerospace
```

previously i used yabai+skhd to manage windows. 
```shell
ln -s ./skhd ~/.config/skhd
ln -s ./yabai ~/.config/yabai
```
